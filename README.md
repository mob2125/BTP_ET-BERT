## **Project Scope: Reproducing and Distilling ET-BERT for University Network Data**

**Project Goal:**

To reproduce the ET-BERT model for the specific domain of university network data and subsequently distill it into a smaller, more computationally efficient model, while maintaining or improving its performance on relevant tasks.

**Scope:**

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   * **Data Collection:** Gather a suitable dataset of university network data, ensuring it contains relevant features like user interactions, network topology, and temporal information.
   * **Data Cleaning:** Address any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers in the data.
   * **Data Transformation:** Convert the data into a format suitable for training the ET-BERT model, such as tokenized sequences and corresponding labels.

2. **ET-BERT Model Reproduction:**
   * **Architecture Implementation:** Implement the original ET-BERT architecture, including the encoder-decoder structure, attention mechanisms, and temporal modeling components.
   * **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameter values (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) to optimize the model's performance.
   * **Training and Evaluation:** Train the ET-BERT model on the prepared dataset using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) to evaluate its performance on tasks like link prediction, node classification, or community detection.

3. **Model Distillation:**
   * **Teacher-Student Setup:** Establish a teacher-student framework where the original ET-BERT model (teacher) guides the training of a smaller, distilled model (student).
   * **Knowledge Transfer Techniques:** Explore various knowledge transfer techniques (e.g., knowledge distillation, attention transfer, parameter sharing) to transfer the teacher's knowledge to the student.
   * **Distilled Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the distilled model on the same tasks as the original ET-BERT model, comparing their accuracy and computational efficiency.

4. **Analysis and Reporting:**
   * **Performance Comparison:** Analyze the performance differences between the original and distilled ET-BERT models, considering factors like accuracy, computational cost, and inference time.
   * **Insights and Recommendations:** Provide insights into the effectiveness of the distillation techniques used and offer recommendations for future work.
   * **Documentation and Reporting:** Create comprehensive documentation and reports detailing the project methodology, results, and conclusions.

**Deliverables:**

* **Preprocessed Dataset:** A cleaned and transformed dataset suitable for training the ET-BERT model.
* **Trained ET-BERT Model:** The original ET-BERT model trained on the prepared dataset.
* **Distilled ET-BERT Model:** A smaller, more efficient version of the ET-BERT model.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Comparative analysis of the original and distilled models' performance on relevant tasks.
* **Project Report:** A detailed report outlining the project methodology, results, and conclusions.
